C'mon, c'mon (yeah)
Can you feel me? (Baby, can you feel me?)
I got something to say
Check it out

For all this time, I've been lovin' you, girl
Oh, yes I have
And ever since the day you left me here alone
I've been trying to find, oh, the reason why

So if I did something wrong, please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want this love to ever end

And I swear, if you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh yeah (back into my life)
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side
'Cause baby, you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)

I watched you go
You've taken my heart with you, oh, yes you did
Every time I try to reach you on the phone
Baby, you're never there, girl, you're never home

So if I did something wrong, please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want this love to ever end
No, no, no, no

I swear, if you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh yeah (back into my life)
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side
'Cause baby, you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)

Maybe I didn't know how to show it (how to show it)
And maybe I didn't know what to say (to say)
This time I won't disguise (won't disguise)
Than we can build our lives and we can be as one, oh (be as one)

I swear, if you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh yeah (back into my life)
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side (by my side)
'Cause baby, you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)

And I swear, if you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
(Come back to me) oh yeah (back into my life)
(Come back into my life)

And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side
